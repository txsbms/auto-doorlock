# Password-Based Door Lock

School project for EE128 at UC Riverside.

Team Members: Thomas Sullivan, Edward Haro

This project is a door lock which will unlock when the user inputs a correct password. Otherwise, it will lock. When unlocked, the user has the choice of changing the password, or entering a mode which operates the lock through light detection. If no input is provided for several seconds, the lock automatically locks again.

Files outside of Sources were created using Kinetis Design Studio 3.
