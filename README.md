# Password-Based Door Lock

School project for EE128 at UC Riverside.

This project is a door lock which will unlock when the user inputs a correct password. Otherwise, it will lock. When unlocked, the user has the choice of changing the password, or entering a mode which operates the lock through light detection. If no input is provided for several seconds, the lock automatically locks again.
